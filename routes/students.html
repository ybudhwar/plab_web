                            <div>Sambath RD, a native of Kerala, received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University
                                of Kerala and Masters of Fine
                                Arts (Visual Media) from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham University. Sambath is interested in
                                researching how human behavior
                                is influenced by environmental features, specifically how elements and principles of
                                communication design and art
                                (color, shape, surface finishes) affect human wayfinding behavior. Currently Sambath is
                                a Ph.D. student in the
                                discipline of Cognitive Ergonomics. His research interests include, but are not limited
                                to, the opposing roles of color
                                and elements of design in human spatial learning and wayfinding. Using psychophysiology
                                and virtual reality tools and
                                methods, he investigates the impact of landmark identification and route planning
                                strategies in human spatial
                                navigation. He has submitted a research paper on Humanizing Work and Work Environment
                                2021 - IIT Guwahati 2021, and also
                                presented a lighting talk at International Interdisciplinary Computational Cognitive
                                Science Summer School 2021. Outside
                                of the lab, he thoroughly enjoys being with his family and friends, paintings,
                                sculpting, gardening, and cooking.

                                University of Varanasi. She is a PhD student at the Indian Institute of Technology
                                Roorkee. Ankitaâ€™s research interests
                                include, but are not limited to, the opposing roles of fear in human learning and memory
                                reconsolidation processes.
                                Particularly, the effect of music on fear extinction using the paradigm of memory
                                reconsolidation. Through the use of
                                psychophysiology methods, she is investigating how the presence of a music during memory
                                reconsolidation process can
                                update and modify fear extinction, and further prevent relapse of fearful behaviours.
                                Outside of the lab, she thoroughly
                                enjoys music, cooking, reading, being with plants and writing blogs.

                                psychology. Tripureshwari is interested in memory processes and how they can be

                                by emotions. These questions
                                would be achieved by devising a multivariate model using behavioural and physiological
                                measures. Simultaneously, she is
                                also interested in fear conditioning and prediction error, believing that her research
